Microfrontend Interview !!

ðŸ”´ Interviewer: What are microfrontends, and why would you use them? 
Candidate: Microfrontends break a large monolithic frontend into smaller, manageable pieces. They allow independent development, deployment, and scaling of features while enabling teams to use diverse tech stacks.

ðŸ”´ Interviewer: Sounds great! But how do you handle routing between microfrontends?
Candidate:
For client-side, Iâ€™d use a router library like single-spa or integrate routing at the shell level.
For server-side rendering, Iâ€™d ensure the shell handles route resolution and passes it to microfrontends.

ðŸ”´ Interviewer: Whatâ€™s your strategy for sharing common libraries between microfrontends?
Candidate:
Leverage Webpack Module Federation to share dependencies dynamically.
Use a shared npm package for utilities or components to ensure consistency.

ðŸ”´ Interviewer: How do you ensure each microfrontend is performant?
Candidate:
Keep bundles small with code splitting and lazy loading.
Optimize critical rendering paths for faster load times.
Use a CDN to cache shared resources.

ðŸ”´ Interviewer: What if one microfrontend fails? How do you handle it?
Candidate:
Implement graceful degradation by showing a fallback UI or error message.
Log the issue for debugging without crashing the entire app.

ðŸ”´ Interviewer: What challenges would you anticipate while implementing microfrontends?
Candidate:
Managing team collaboration when multiple teams work on the same app.
Versioning conflicts between shared dependencies.
Complexity in CI/CD pipelines.

ðŸ”´ Interviewer: Can you share a real-world use case for microfrontends?
Candidate:
E-commerce apps, where the cart, search, and product pages are handled by different teams.
Large-scale enterprise apps, where independent teams own specific domains like reporting or analytics.
