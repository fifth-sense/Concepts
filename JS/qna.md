In React, the `useLayoutEffect` hook is used when you need to perform side effects that must **synchronously** occur before the browser repaints the screen. It is similar to `useEffect`, but it runs **synchronously after all DOM mutations** and before the browser paints the screen, ensuring that any DOM updates made in the effect are visible to the user immediately.

---

### **Key Reasons to Use `useLayoutEffect`**

1. **DOM Measurement:**
   - When you need to measure the DOM (e.g., element size, position) before the browser repaints.
   - Ensures you get accurate values because it runs before the browser updates the layout.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     import { useLayoutEffect, useRef, useState } from 'react';

     function Component() {
         const ref = useRef();
         const [width, setWidth] = useState(0);

         useLayoutEffect(() => {
             setWidth(ref.current.offsetWidth);
         }, []);

         return <div ref={ref}>Width: {width}px</div>;
     }
     ```

2. **Avoiding Visual Glitches:**
   - When updating the DOM or performing a calculation that must happen immediately to prevent flickers or layout shifts.
   - Example: Adjusting scroll position or applying styles based on measurements.

3. **Synchronizing with DOM Changes:**
   - When you need to manipulate the DOM directly after React has made its updates but before the user sees it.
   - Example: Updating a scrollbar position or animating an element after its dimensions change.

### **Difference Between `useEffect` and `useLayoutEffect`**

| Feature                  | `useEffect`                        | `useLayoutEffect`                  |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Timing**               | Runs after the browser repaints.   | Runs before the browser repaints.  |
| **Use Case**             | Non-urgent side effects, like data fetching or logging. | DOM-related updates that need to happen before the screen updates. |
| **Performance Impact**   | Non-blocking, allows browser to repaint first. | Blocking, delays browser repaint until it completes. |

---

### **When Should You Avoid `useLayoutEffect`?**

- **Performance Considerations:** Since it blocks the browser from painting, overusing it can lead to performance bottlenecks.
- **Non-DOM-Related Logic:** For tasks like fetching data or updating state that donâ€™t involve the DOM, prefer `useEffect`.

---

### **When to Use `useLayoutEffect`:**
- Measuring DOM dimensions or layout.
- Fixing visual glitches caused by asynchronous updates.
- Synchronizing animations with DOM changes.

Use `useLayoutEffect` sparingly and only when necessary, as it can impact rendering performance if misused.

/**
 * How do promises differ from async/await? Which would you use in a given scenario?
 * Promises and async/await are both used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript.
Syntax	
Uses 
.then() and .catch() for chaining callbacks. promises	
Syntactic sugar over promises; 
uses async functions and await keyword for cleaner code. async/await

Readability	
Can become harder to read with complex chains ("callback hell"-like).	
Easier to read and write, resembling synchronous code.

Error Handling	
Errors are caught with .catch() or try...catch.	Errors are handled with try...catch directly,
 making it more intuitive.

Control Flow	
Requires chaining or nesting .then() to handle sequential or dependent async operations.	
Executes code sequentially, making it simpler to write logic for dependent async tasks.

Parallel Execution	
Promises can be used with Promise.all() for parallel execution of multiple tasks.	
await runs tasks sequentially unless explicitly managed with Promise.all() or similar constructs.

Debugging	
Slightly harder to debug due to chaining and asynchronous stack traces.	
Easier to debug since stack traces often appear more like synchronous code.

//how we can fix the starvation issue of callback queue when microtask queue having so many functions
/**
 * 
Starvation of the callback queue occurs when the microtask queue continuously receives tasks, preventing the event loop from reaching the callback queue. This happens because microtasks (like Promise callbacks and MutationObserver tasks) have higher priority in the event loop and 
are processed before the callback queue (e.g., setTimeout or setInterval callbacks).

Use setTimeout or setImmediate in Microtasks

## React Diffing Algorithm
React uses two main strategies for reconciliation:

Tree Diffing:

React compares two trees (old virtual DOM vs. new virtual DOM).
If the root nodes of two trees differ, React replaces the entire tree.
Component Diffing:

For components of the same type, React updates the props and state while keeping the existing DOM structure.
For different component types, React unmounts the old component and mounts the new one.
Element Diffing:

React compares child nodes within the same parent.
If keys are used, React matches elements more efficiently, avoiding unnecessary removals or insertions.
