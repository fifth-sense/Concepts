setImmediate():
setImmediate Executes immediately after the current event loop iteration, making it ideal for time-sensitive tasks 
without delay. It has higher priority than other I/O events and timers, potentially causing starvation of other tasks 
due to its immediate execution.

setTimeout():
Executes after a specified delay (in milliseconds), making it suitable for implementing delays or timeouts in code. 
It has a lower priority compared to setImmediate(), reducing the likelihood of starving other tasks in the event loop.
