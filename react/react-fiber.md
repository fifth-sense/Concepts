## üß† Part 1: What is React Fiber?

### ‚úÖ Definition

React Fiber is the **complete rewrite of React's core algorithm**, introduced in React 16. It improves rendering performance and introduces incremental rendering.

---

## üîç Why was Fiber introduced?

Before React Fiber, React used a **stack-based algorithm**, which was synchronous and couldn't be paused. This made it hard to manage performance, especially in complex apps.

**Problem with old system:**

* Blocking UI
* Poor handling of animations or heavy computations

## üöÄ Features of React Fiber

| Feature                     | Description                                                                 |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Incremental Rendering**   | Breaks rendering into units of work that can be paused, aborted, or reused  |
| **Concurrency**             | Allows multiple tasks to be handled in parallel                             |
| **Prioritization**          | Assigns priority to different updates (e.g., animations > background fetch) |
| **Error Boundaries**        | Improved error handling during render phase                                 |
| **Backwards Compatibility** | Supports class components and older APIs                                    |

## üß™ Part 2: Practical Understanding (with Diagrams if needed)

### üß± How Fiber works (Simplified Internals):

1. React builds a **Fiber Tree**, which is similar to the virtual DOM.
2. It uses **‚ÄúWork Units‚Äù**: each component update is broken into smaller pieces.
3. Two main phases:

   * **Render Phase (Reconciliation)**: Prepares what needs to change.
   * **Commit Phase**: Actually updates the DOM.

### üéØ Example Code (Under the Hood Understanding)

```jsx
function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);
  return (
    <div>
      <p>{count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

With React Fiber:

* `setCount` schedules an update.
* Fiber breaks it into a **unit of work**.
* React prioritizes it (based on urgency) and processes accordingly.

## üí° Key Concepts with Practical Insights

### 1. **Concurrency (Time Slicing)**

```jsx
// Simulates low-priority rendering
startTransition(() => {
  setSearchResults(expensiveSearch(query));
});
```

‚úÖ **Why it matters**: UI stays responsive while React works in the background.

---

### 2. **Error Boundaries**

```jsx
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  componentDidCatch(error, info) {
    logErrorToService(error, info);
  }

  render() {
    return this.props.children;
  }
}
```

‚úÖ **Benefit**: Prevents full app crash due to component error.

---

### 3. **Suspense + Concurrent Rendering**

```jsx
<Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
  <DataComponent />
</Suspense>
```

‚úÖ Works well with `React.lazy()` or async data fetching libraries like React Query.

---

## ‚úÖ Pros of React Fiber

* Time slicing for non-blocking rendering
* Smooth UX even with large updates
* Better error handling
* Supports new features like Suspense, Concurrent Mode
* Backward-compatible

---

## ‚ùå Cons of React Fiber

* Slight learning curve to understand inner workings
* Performance tuning can be tricky without understanding priority queues
* Some third-party libraries needed updates to adapt to React 16+

| "How does React Fiber handle prioritization of tasks?"               | Depth of Fiber internals | 
*React Fiber assigns a priority level to each update. Critical updates like user inputs or animations are handled first, while less urgent updates are deferred.*                                                                          |
